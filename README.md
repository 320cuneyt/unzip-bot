# **THIS IS BETA BRANCH, DON'T BE MAD AT ME IF IT'S BUGGY üòû**
[![Manual deploy of beta branch](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/actions/workflows/beta-auto-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=beta)](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/actions/workflows/beta-auto-deploy.yml)  
  
  
## Bugs to fix and features to add üíÄ  
  
- [ ] The ETA isn't accurate
- [x] ~~Download speed stays constant, depending of what we have at begining. If the download started at 3 Mb/s, it will stay like that through all the process and can't evolve~~ **Seems to have been fixed**
- [ ] Unzipping normally a password protected archive makes crash the bot üò≠
- [ ] [Reply markup error](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/2)
- [ ] Adding file name in description while uploading
- [ ] Adding a `/db` command that returns a list of all users + banned ones
- [ ] ~~Looks like some "blank" users are added to the db, including a banned one~~ *Actually, the banned db can exist only if at least 1 value is inside. So, since owner have all rights, his ID can be added into it, the owner status will bypass it. But I noticed also other banned users while no `/ban` command were done. Investigating on this‚Ä¶*
- [ ] Add a translation (start a CrowdIn dude)
- [ ] ~~Some profile links doesn't work~~ **Private ones. But maybe I can force it‚Ä¶**
- [ ] Get informations with smth like `/user {id}`, that returns his state (banned or not) + lastly uploaded files (5 last with link to channel/group message) + how many files he sent + size of all of them. The user could also get those infos with a `/me` command
- [ ] Add a `/dbdive` that returns an url where we can visualize the db online
- [ ] Add status of extraction in logs (uploaded, started, extracted, failed (+ error), what is the password, ‚Ä¶)
- [ ] Add more things to `/stats` like average speed, ‚Ä¶
- [ ] Add cancel process button for downloads and an emergency `/redbutton` one
- [ ] Add an emergency `/restart` command that can be run **even** if the bot hanged up
- [ ] Add permathumb support `/addthumb` `/delthumb`
- [ ] Auto use `/clean` when a task failed
- [ ] Keep the archives 5 hours in server just in case someone resend the same (no download twice)
- [ ] Add a `/cleanall` for forcing the server reset and freeing space
- [ ] Add group support. You add bot to group as admin, then reply to any file with `/extract`. Then you choose where goes the files (group or PM), and drop here do the instructions (pass or no, what to upload, ‚Ä¶)
