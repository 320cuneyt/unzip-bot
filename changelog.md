### v4.0.3 *(.2 don't exists ðŸ¥²)*
+ `/mode` work finally as expected. Previous behavior added users to banned db when they changed their upload mode, thus the command couldn't work. That huge bug is present in Nexa's repo
+ Created a TimeFormatter with seconds as input
+ Created upload file count (buggy). Barely saves in DB + only shows up in logs when user selected upload all mode
+ Logs message now replies to the concerned archive. Better if multiple archives are processed at the same time
+ Errors shows up in logs
+ Created an empty keyboard where only Upload all & Cancel shows up
+ Fixed major bug : REPLY_MARKUP_TOO_LONG (refer to [issue #2](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/2))
+ Try to close session (to fix [issue #4](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/4))

### v4.0.1
+ Tried to fetch the SITERM signal
+ Trying to fix a bug where the User Id no longer shows up in logs

### v4.0.0
+ Added logging instead of print
+ Bot sends start time to logs *(may send stop time as well, but I need to handle SIGTERM gracefully)*
